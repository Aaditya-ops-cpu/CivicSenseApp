It provides in-depth, topic-specific guides on social norms, dining etiquette, public conduct, and more. After studying the material, users can take a 15-question quiz for each country to solidify their understanding and prepare for their journey.

The entire application is built as a single-page web app, making it fast, lightweight, and easy to run on any device with a web browser.
