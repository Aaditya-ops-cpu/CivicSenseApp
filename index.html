                'France': {
                    title: 'Civic Sense in France',
                    content: {
                        'Greetings & Formality': `<p>Politeness is the absolute cornerstone of French social interaction. It is not merely a pleasantry but a required social lubricant. <strong>Always greet and say goodbye.</strong> A simple "Bonjour" (Good day) upon entering any establishment—a shop, café, doctor's waiting room, or even an elevator—is essential. Failing to do so is seen as extremely rude. When leaving, always say "Au revoir" (Goodbye). After dusk, "Bonsoir" (Good evening) replaces "Bonjour".</p><p>Addressing people correctly is also vital. Use "Madame" for women, "Monsieur" for men. "Mademoiselle" for young women is becoming less common and can be seen as dated or even slightly sexist; "Madame" is a safer default. The distinction between the formal "vous" (you) and informal "tu" (you) is critical. As a visitor, <strong>always default to "vous"</strong> with strangers, anyone older than you, and in all professional or commercial settings. Using "tu" without being invited to is overly familiar and can cause offense. You will know it's okay to use "tu" if a French person starts using it with you, or explicitly says "on peut se tutoyer" (we can use "tu" with each other).</p>`,
                        'Dining Etiquette': `<p>Meals are cherished, often lengthy, social rituals. When dining at someone's home, it's polite to arrive about 15 minutes late. Punctuality is for business, not social dinners. When dining in a restaurant, wait for your host or the eldest person to say "Bon appétit" before you begin eating. It's customary to <strong>keep both hands visible on the table,</strong> with wrists resting on the edge—never in your lap. Bread is not served with a side plate; you place it directly on the tablecloth next to your plate. Use it to accompany your food, but do not use it to mop up sauces until the very end of the dish, if at all. When you finish, place your knife and fork parallel on the plate at the 4 o'clock position.</p><p>Tipping is not obligatory in the same way as in the US. A service charge of 15% ("service compris") is legally included in the bill. However, for good service, it is customary to leave a small extra amount (a few euros in coins) on the table. This is called a "pourboire" (literally, "for a drink").</p>`,
                        'Public Conduct': `<p>The French generally value discretion and calm in public spaces. <strong>Speaking loudly on mobile phones,</strong> especially in the confined spaces of a bus or the Métro, is considered very rude. If you must take a call, be brief and quiet. Similarly, loud conversations among your group will attract negative attention. Maintain a low volume in museums, churches, and restaurants. Queuing is expected and respected; do not push or cut in line. On escalators, particularly in the Paris Métro, it is a strict and non-negotiable rule to <strong>stand on the right</strong> to allow those in a hurry to walk on the left. Blocking the left side will earn you audible sighs and pointed comments.</p>`,
                        'Dress Code & Appearance': `<p>The French, particularly in cities like Paris, place a high value on appearance. This doesn't necessarily mean expensive clothes, but rather being well-put-together, neat, and stylish. For evening meals at a nice restaurant, smart casual is the minimum. Avoid wearing athletic wear, shorts, or flip-flops for anything other than their intended purpose (sports or the beach). Even for casual sightseeing, opting for smart trousers or a skirt over jogging bottoms will help you blend in more. When visiting religious buildings, ensure your shoulders and knees are covered.</p>`,
                        'Business Etiquette': `<p>Punctuality is absolutely expected in business settings; being late is a sign of disrespect. Handshakes are the standard greeting for both men and women—a quick, firm grip. Business cards are exchanged after the initial introductions. The French appreciate well-reasoned, logical arguments and intellectual debate. Business meetings can be more about discussion and exchanging viewpoints than immediate decision-making. Decisions are often made by the highest-ranking person in a hierarchical structure, so be patient. Building a personal relationship is often a prerequisite for doing business.</p>`,
                        'Cultural Context': `<ul><li><strong>Laïcité (Secularism):</strong> France has a very strict form of secularism. Religion is considered a private matter. Avoid wearing conspicuous religious symbols in government buildings and public schools.</li><li><strong>Strikes (Grèves):</strong> Strikes are a common part of French life and are seen as a legitimate way to express dissent. Be prepared for potential disruptions to transport and services, and check news updates if you are traveling during a strike period.</li><li><strong>Helpful Phrase:</strong> "Je ne comprends pas" (I don't understand). It's better to admit you don't understand than to nod along incorrectly.</li></ul>`,
                    }
                },
                'Spain': {
                    title: 'Civic Sense in Spain',
                    content: {
                        'Social Culture': `<p>Spain boasts a vibrant, sociable, and often loud culture. Don't mistake passionate, expressive conversations for arguments; animated discussion with gestures is the norm. Greetings are warm and tactile. Friends and family often exchange <strong>"dos besos" (two kisses), starting with the right cheek then the left.</strong> In professional or new settings, a firm handshake is standard. It's polite to say "Hola" upon meeting, and "Adiós" or the more common "Hasta luego" (see you later) when leaving. In shops, a simple "Buenos días" (Good morning) or "Buenas tardes" (Good afternoon) is expected.</p>`,
                        'Meal Times & Siesta': `<p>Spanish schedules can be a shock to visitors. <strong>Lunch ("la comida") is the main meal of the day,</strong> typically a multi-course affair eaten between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM. Dinner ("la cena") is much lighter and served very late, usually after 9:00 PM or even 10:00 PM. Many businesses, especially smaller, family-run shops outside major tourist centers, close for a <strong>"siesta"</strong> in the afternoon (approximately 2-5 PM). While this is less common in large corporations and big cities like Madrid and Barcelona, the rhythm of life still slows down significantly in the afternoon.</p>`,
                        'Tapas & Dining': `<p>Tapas culture is a core part of Spanish social life. It's not just about food; it's a social event. It's common to stand at the bar, have one or two tapas and a drink, and then move on to the next bar ("ir de tapas"). Tipping is not as ingrained as in other countries. It is common to round up the bill or leave a small amount of change (a euro or two) for good service, but a 15-20% tip is not expected. Don't rush your meals. The "sobremesa," or time spent talking at the table after a meal has finished, is a cherished tradition and can last for hours.</p>`,
                        'Public Behavior': `<p>Spaniards are generally relaxed about noise, and public life often unfolds in the streets, squares, and cafes. Punctuality is flexible for social engagements; arriving 15-20 minutes late for a dinner party is normal and expected. However, for official appointments, transport, or business meetings, you should be on time. It's considered rude to be barefoot anywhere other than a beach or pool. Yawning or stretching in public should be done discreetly.</p>`,
                        'Regional Identity': `<p>Spain is a country of fiercely proud autonomous regions. Many Spaniards identify more with their region (e.g., Catalonia, Andalusia, Basque Country) than with Spain as a whole. Be sensitive to this. In regions like Catalonia and the Basque Country, you will see signs in their own languages (Catalan and Euskara) as well as Spanish. Using a few words in the local language can be a very appreciated gesture. Avoid discussing sensitive topics like the Franco regime or regional separatism unless you are very familiar with the person and the context.</p>`,
                        'Cultural Tips': `<ul><li>Avoid stereotypes about bullfighting and flamenco; not all Spaniards identify with them and they can be sensitive topics.</li><li>Be patient. The pace of life, especially in the south, is more relaxed. The concept of "mañana" doesn't always mean tomorrow, but rather "not today."</li><li><strong>Helpful Phrase:</strong> "No pasa nada" (It's okay/No problem). This phrase embodies the relaxed Spanish attitude to life.</li></ul>`,

                    content: {
                        'Tipping Culture': `<p>Tipping is a fundamental and effectively non-optional aspect of American service culture. The federal minimum wage for tipped workers is extremely low, so they rely on tips for the majority of their income. <strong>A standard tip for good service in a restaurant is 15-20%</strong> of the pre-tax bill. For exceptional service, 25% is not uncommon. Less than 15% implies you were unhappy with the service. You should also tip bartenders ($1-2 per drink), taxi/rideshare drivers (10-15%), hotel staff (bellhops, valets), hairdressers, and tour guides. Not tipping is a serious social blunder.</p>`,
                        'Communication & Space': `<p>Americans generally value personal space and may feel uncomfortable if a stranger stands too close during a conversation (<strong>an arm's length is a good guide</strong>). Communication tends to be direct and explicit. "How are you?" is a common greeting, not a genuine inquiry into your well-being; a simple "Good, thanks, how are you?" is the expected response. Small talk with strangers—cashiers, people in a queue, servers—is very common and considered friendly. Americans are also generally more open about sharing personal stories than people in many other cultures, but avoid sensitive topics like politics, religion, and salary with new acquaintances.</p>`,
                        'Public Order & Punctuality': `<p><strong>Queuing (or "standing in line") is strictly observed.</strong> Cutting in line is considered extremely rude and will likely be called out by others. Punctuality is very important in both business and social settings. Being on time for appointments and meetings is expected. If you are going to be more than 5-10 minutes late, it is polite to call or text to notify the person you are meeting. Being "fashionably late" is not a widely accepted concept.</p>`,
                        'Driving Etiquette': `<p>The US is a car-centric country. Rules of the road are generally followed. The horn is used almost exclusively for warnings, not for greetings or expressing minor frustration. "Tailgating" (driving too close to the car in front) is considered aggressive and dangerous. It's common to give a brief, friendly wave as a "thank you" if another driver lets you merge into traffic.</p>`,
                        'Business Etiquette': `<p>A firm handshake with direct eye contact is the standard greeting. Business culture is often fast-paced, individualistic, and results-oriented. Time is considered a valuable commodity, so meetings tend to be efficient and stick to an agenda. Dress code can vary significantly by industry and region, from the formal suits of Wall Street to the very casual attire of Silicon Valley tech companies.</p>`,
                        'Cultural Context': `<ul><li><strong>Individualism:</strong> The culture highly values independence and self-reliance.</li><li><strong>Consumerism:</strong> The price you see on a sales tag is almost never the final price; sales tax is added at the register. Customer service is often very proactive, and returning items to stores is usually a straightforward process.</li><li><strong>Helpful Phrase:</strong> "Could you tell me where the restroom is?" ("Restroom" or "bathroom" are the most common terms, not "toilet" or "W.C.").</li></ul>`,

                        '"Face" & Harmony': `<p>Understanding "face" (Mianzi) — a complex concept of honor, reputation, and respect — is crucial. You must <strong>avoid causing someone public embarrassment,</strong> contradicting them openly, or criticizing them in front of others, especially a superior. Giving "face" involves showing respect, offering compliments (which may be deflected out of modesty), and acknowledging someone's status. This principle governs social interaction, emphasizing social harmony and avoiding direct conflict. Instead of a direct "no," you are more likely to hear an indirect response like "I'll see" or "it might be difficult."</p>`,
                        'Dining & Chopsticks': `<p>Meals are often communal, with shared dishes placed on a lazy Susan. Your host will likely order for the table and will serve you the best pieces of food to show honor. It's polite to try a little of everything. <strong>Never stick your chopsticks upright in your bowl of rice,</strong> as this resembles incense sticks at a funeral and is a major taboo. Do not use your chopsticks to point at people or dishes. When not using them, rest them on the provided chopstick rest or horizontally on the side of your bowl. To thank someone for pouring you tea, you can gently tap your index and middle fingers on the table.</p>`,
                        'Gifts & Business Cards': `<p>When giving or receiving a gift, business card, or even money, <strong>always use both hands</strong> to show respect and importance. Gifts are often refused a couple of times out of politeness before being accepted; you should persist gently. It is customary not to open a gift in front of the giver. When receiving a business card, take a moment to read it carefully before putting it away in a card case or wallet; do not just stuff it in your pocket or write on it.</p>`,
                        'Social Norms & Hierarchy': `<p>Chinese society is hierarchical, and respect for age and seniority is paramount. The oldest person is served first, enters a room first, and is deferred to in conversation. Personal space is less of a concept than in the West, so be prepared for crowded conditions in public. Punctuality is highly valued; being early for appointments is a sign of respect.</p>`,
                        'Digital Etiquette': `<p>China is a highly digital and mobile-first society. WeChat is ubiquitous for everything from messaging and social media to payments and official business. Exchanging WeChat contacts is the modern equivalent of exchanging business cards. Mobile payments (WeChat Pay or Alipay) are the norm, and cash is becoming increasingly rare in major cities.</p>`,
                        'Cultural Context': `<ul><li>The number 4 is considered very unlucky as it sounds like the word for "death." Conversely, 8 is a very lucky number associated with wealth.</li><li>Be mindful of your feet; do not point them at people or use them to move objects.</li><li><strong>Helpful Phrase:</strong> "Mǎidān" (My-dahn) - "The bill, please." Used in restaurants.</li></ul>`,

                    content: {
                        'Coffee Culture': `<p>Coffee is an art form and a daily ritual with strict, unwritten rules. An espresso, simply called "un caffè," is the standard. <strong>Cappuccinos and other milky coffees are strictly for the morning</strong> and are never ordered after 11 AM, and certainly not after a meal (it's believed the milk hinders digestion). It's common practice to order and drink your coffee standing at the bar ("al banco"), which is quicker and often cheaper than sitting at a table ("al tavolo"), where a service charge is added.</p>`,
                        'Appearance & "La Bella Figura"': `<p>The concept of "la bella figura" (making a beautiful figure) is very important. It's about presenting yourself with style, confidence, and grace in all situations. This is reflected in the way Italians dress; they are often very fashion-conscious. Even for a casual walk, people are well-dressed. Avoid overly casual or sloppy attire like gym clothes or flip-flops in cities and towns. When visiting churches and religious sites, it is mandatory to <strong>dress modestly. This means covering your shoulders and knees.</strong></p>`,
                        'Punctuality & Dining': `<p>In social situations, particularly in the south, punctuality is relaxed. Being "fashionably late" (15-30 minutes) for a dinner invitation is common. However, for business meetings or formal appointments, you should be punctual. Meals are structured, often with multiple courses (antipasto, primo, secondo, dolce). <strong>Do not ask for extra cheese on a seafood pasta dish,</strong> as this is considered a culinary sin. Also, do not cut spaghetti with a knife; learn to twirl it with a fork. Salads are typically eaten after the main course.</p>`,
                        'Public Behavior': `<p>The "passeggiata," or leisurely evening stroll, is a beloved tradition, especially on weekends. It's a time for socializing and being seen. When speaking, Italians use a lot of hand gestures which are an integral part of communication. Personal space is closer than in many other cultures. The concept of queuing is somewhat more flexible than in Northern Europe; be prepared to hold your ground politely but firmly.</p>`,
                        'Regionalism & Family': `<p>Family is the center of Italian society. Strong loyalty is to the family first and foremost. There is also a powerful sense of regional pride, known as "campanilismo" (loyalty to one's own bell tower). An Italian may identify as Sicilian or Tuscan before identifying as Italian. Be aware of the distinct cultural differences and friendly rivalries between regions, particularly between the north and the south.</p>`,
                        'Cultural Tips': `<ul><li>Don't expect shops to be open in the middle of the day. The "riposo" (similar to a siesta) is common from around 1 PM to 4 PM.</li><li>Never touch produce at a market stall with your bare hands; use the provided plastic gloves or ask the vendor for assistance.</li><li><strong>Helpful Phrase:</strong> "Posso?" (May I?) - A polite way to ask for permission before taking a photo of someone or entering a small shop.</li></ul>`,

                    content: {
                        'Hospitality & Respect': `<p>Turkish culture is renowned for its exceptional hospitality ("misafirperverlik"). It's common to be offered tea ("çay") or coffee by shopkeepers and locals as a gesture of friendship, and it's polite to accept, even if just for a few minutes of conversation. <strong>Respect for elders is deeply ingrained.</strong> When greeting an elder, it is a traditional sign of respect to kiss their right hand and then bring it to your forehead. Address people older than you with formal titles like "abi" (older brother), "abla" (older sister), "amca" (uncle), or "teyze" (aunt).</p>`,
                        'Visiting Mosques & Homes': `<p>When entering a mosque, you must <strong>remove your shoes.</strong> Dress modestly: men should wear long trousers, and women should cover their heads, shoulders, arms, and legs. Most major mosques provide scarves for visitors. Visit outside of the five daily prayer times, and behave quietly and respectfully inside. Similarly, you should always remove your shoes when entering a Turkish home.</p>`,
                        'Gestures & Communication': `<p>Certain gestures can be misinterpreted. Making an "OK" sign with your thumb and forefinger can be considered a grave insult. To say "no," you don't need to shake your head; a <strong>single upward tilt of the head, often accompanied by a "tsk" sound,</strong> is sufficient. Pointing directly at someone with your finger is considered rude. To beckon someone, you use a downward scooping motion with your hand, palm down.</p>`,
                        'Bargaining & Shopping': `<p>Bargaining ("pazarlık") is expected and is a normal part of the shopping experience in markets and bazaars like the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul. It should be done in a friendly, respectful manner. The first price quoted is rarely the final price. Start by offering about half the asking price and work your way to a mutually agreeable amount. However, in modern shops, boutiques, and malls, prices are fixed.</p>`,
                        'National Pride': `<p>Turks are very proud of their country and its history. Be extremely respectful of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic. Insulting him or the Turkish flag is illegal and deeply offensive. Avoid making critical comments about the government or sensitive political topics unless you are in a trusted, private setting.</p>`,
                        'Cultural Tips': `<ul><li>Avoid public displays of affection; they are generally frowned upon.</li><li>During the holy month of Ramadan, be considerate of those who are fasting and avoid eating, drinking, or smoking openly on the street during the day in more conservative areas.</li><li><strong>Helpful Phrase:</strong> "Kolay gelsin" (May it come easy) - A wonderful phrase to say to anyone who is working, from a shopkeeper to a cleaner. It is highly appreciated.</li></ul>`,

                    content: {
                        'Greetings & Mateship': `<p>Australian culture is famously informal and laid-back. A simple "G'day" or "How are you going?" is a standard greeting. First names are used almost immediately, regardless of age or status. <strong>Mateship is a core cultural value,</strong> signifying loyalty, equality, and friendship. While a handshake is appropriate for a first or formal meeting, a casual nod or wave is more common. Don't be surprised by a friendly and direct communication style.</p>`,
                        'Pub & BBQ Etiquette': `<p>The pub is a central hub for socializing. Like in the UK, you order and pay at the bar. The "shout" system is crucial: if you are with a group, you are expected to take your turn buying a "round" of drinks for everyone. It is considered rude to leave before it's your turn to shout. At a BBQ or "barbie," it is very common to be asked to <strong>"bring a plate,"</strong> which means bringing a dish to share (like a salad or dessert). Often, invitations will also be "BYO" (Bring Your Own), meaning you should bring your own alcoholic beverages.</p>`,
                        'Public Conduct': `<p>Like the British, Australians are strict about queuing. Always wait your turn in line. Politeness is valued, so "please" and "thank you" are essential. Thanking the bus driver when you get off is a common courtesy. Littering is highly frowned upon. Australians have a unique slang, and while you don't need to use it, understanding terms like "arvo" (afternoon) or "brekkie" (breakfast) can be helpful.</p>`,
                        'Tipping Culture': `<p><strong>Tipping is not a standard practice in Australia.</strong> Minimum wages are high, so service staff do not rely on tips for their income. It is entirely optional. For exceptional service in a high-end restaurant, you might round up the bill or leave about 10%, but it is not expected. You do not tip bartenders, taxi drivers, or hotel staff.</p>`,
                        'Beach Safety': `<p>Beach culture is integral to the Australian lifestyle, but it comes with important safety rules. Always <strong>"swim between the flags."</strong> These red and yellow flags mark the safest area of the beach patrolled by lifeguards ("lifesavers"). Swimming outside these areas can be extremely dangerous due to strong currents known as rips. Heed all warning signs and instructions from lifeguards.</p>`,
                        'Cultural Context': `<ul><li><strong>Egalitarianism:</strong> Australians have a strong belief in a "fair go" (a fair chance) for everyone and a general dislike for authority and pretentiousness.</li><li><strong>Sense of Humour:</strong> The humour is often dry, ironic, and self-deprecating. "Taking the piss" (teasing someone light-heartedly) is a common form of affection between friends.</li><li><strong>Helpful Phrase:</strong> "No worries." This is a quintessential Australian phrase used for "you're welcome," "it's okay," or "don't worry about it."</li></ul>`,

                    content: {
                        'The Art of Queuing': `<p>The queue (or "line") is a sacred institution in the UK. <strong>Jumping a queue is one of the biggest social faux pas you can commit.</strong> It is seen as fundamentally unfair. Whether it's for a bus, at a shop checkout, or in a post office, always find the back of the queue and wait your turn patiently. Even when there isn't a formal line, there's often an unspoken understanding of who is next.</p>`,
                        'Pub Etiquette': `<p>Pubs (Public Houses) are central to British social life. Table service is rare; you are expected to <strong>go to the bar to order your drinks and food.</strong> Find a table first, note the table number if you're ordering food, then go to the bar. When you are with a group, it is customary to buy drinks in "rounds," where each person takes a turn buying drinks for the entire group. It's considered impolite to opt out of a round if you're staying with the group. Tipping is not required at the bar, but for good table service, 10-12% is standard if a service charge isn't already included.</p>`,
                        'Politeness & Understatement': `<p>The British are masters of understatement and often have a dry, sarcastic sense of humor that can be misinterpreted. "Not bad" can mean "very good," and "I'll bear it in mind" might mean "I have no intention of doing that." <strong>Politeness is paramount.</strong> "Please," "thank you," and especially "sorry" are used constantly. People will say "sorry" reflexively if you bump into them, even if it was your fault.</p>`,
                        'Social Interaction': `<p>Talking about the weather is a classic icebreaker and a safe, neutral topic for small talk. The British can be more reserved than Americans and may perceive over-friendliness from a stranger as suspicious. Avoid asking personal questions about salary, wealth, or political affiliation. A friendly nod is a common acknowledgment to strangers. Don't be offended by a lack of overt enthusiasm; it's often just cultural reserve.</p>`,
                        'Transportation Etiquette': `<p>On the London Underground ("the Tube"), there are strict rules. Stand on the right on escalators. Let people off the train before you get on. Do not make eye contact with fellow passengers. On buses outside of London, it's common to thank the driver when you get off.</p>`,
                        'Cultural Context': `<ul><li><strong>Class System:</strong> While less rigid than in the past, a subtle class awareness still exists and can be reflected in accents, education, and manners. It's a complex and sensitive topic.</li><li><strong>"Cheers":</strong> This is a versatile word that can mean "thank you," "goodbye," or be used as a toast.</li><li><strong>Helpful Phrase:</strong> "Are you alright?" or just "Alright?" is a common, informal greeting, equivalent to "How are you?". The expected answer is "Yeah, you?" or simply "Alright."</li></ul>`,
